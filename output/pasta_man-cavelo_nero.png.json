        "Remove and discard the stalks from the cavolo nero and wash the stripped leaves under cold water. Bring a large pan of water to the boil before adding salt. Blanch the leaves for 30 seconds, then immediately transfer them to a bowl of cold water (this will help keep their green colour). Set aside the pan of salted water to cook the pasta in.",
        "Press the cavolo nero leaves to remove as much water as you can, and put them into a food processor or blender. Add the lemon juice. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins and add them to the processor or blender. Start blending the ingredients together, slowly adding the olive oil as you go, and finishing with the Parmesan.",
        "Bring the pan of salted water back to the boil and cook the pappardelle for 1 1/2-2 minutes. At the same time, pour the cavolo nero sauce into a large saucepan on a low heat. When the pasta is cooked, add it to the sauce with a ladleful (or two) of pasta water. Combine together using tongs or simply toss it. Check the seasoning \u2014 it will need salt \u2014 and the sauce might need to be loosened with more pasta water.",
        "Divide between bowls. Place half a ball of burrata on top of each serving, drizzle with olive oil and add a twist of black pepper."

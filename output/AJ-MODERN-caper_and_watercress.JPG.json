Put it into a mixing bowl, add the ground almonds, oats, lemon zest, chopped parsley and a good pinch of salt and pepper, and mix with your hands. Make a well in the centre and add the eggs. Mix it all together, then use your hands to form it into a ball. It won't look like a traditional pastry dough, it will be a little wetter and less firm.",
        "Rub the baking paper with some olive oil, then put the dough in the middle of the baking tray and use your hands to flatten it out until it is about 0.5cm thick, slightly thicker around the edges. Bake for 20 minutes, until golden all over and set into a crust.",
        "Meanwhile, make the filling. Roughly chop the cornichons with the parsley and watercress and put them into a bowl with the capers and ricotta. Add the lemon zest, Parmesan and artichokes, then add the beaten egg and a good pinch of salt and pepper and mix well.",
        "Remove the tart base from the oven and turn the oven up to 240\u00b0C/220\u00b0C fan/gas 9. Spread the topping over the base and finish with some more Parmesan, drizzle with a little more oil, then put back into the oven for another 15 minutes to cook the filling.",
        "Once cooked, serve with some green leaves, a drizzle more oil and a little more Parmesan."

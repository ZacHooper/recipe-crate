    "blurb": "This recipe is made out of stuff | always have on hand in the store cupboard, freezer and fridge. It\u2019s at this time of year that | rely on these staples: frozen peas and preserved lemons add a flash of green and some freshness, an interruption from the roots and grains while we wait for the fresh green march of spring. | make a batch of these and turn them into a few meals: served with a grain and greens for dinner, in a wrap with some pickles or with spaghetti and a spiced tomato sauce (see page 362). | add a little Parmesan to balance the flavour here, but vegans can use nutritional yeast.",

        "Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C/180\u00b0C fan/gas 6 (if you are baking your polpette).",
        "To make the salsa, roughly chop together all the ingredients except the oil. Put in to a bowl and add the oil little by little, stirring well. Taste as you go \u2014 you may not need all the oil.",
        "Put the onion into your food processor with the garlic, coriander seeds and chilli and pulse until the onion is finely chopped. Heat a frying pan, add 3 tablespoons of olive oil, and fry the onion mixture gently until it's soft and fragrant. Next, add the rest of the polpette ingredients to the food processor with a good grind of black pepper and mix until the beans have been mashed and everything has come together.",
        "Shape the polpette. Wet your hands and roll into balls using roughly a tablespoon of mixture for each one (you should get about 18), then place on a baking sheet. If you are baking them, drizzle the balls with a little olive oil and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden. To cook them in a frying pan, chill them for at least 90 minutes, then simply fry them in a little olive oil on a medium heat for about 10-15 minutes, turning every few minutes. Serve with the salsa verde."

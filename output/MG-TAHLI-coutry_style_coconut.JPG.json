    "title": "GAVRAAN MUTTONACHA RASSA",
    "blurb": "This is a recipe from my hometown of Mumbai, and one that my family has been cooking for over two decades. With influences from surrounding communities across the west of India, this recipe is cooked with coarsely crushed spices and lamb on the bone. With its rustic flavours, this rassa (gravy) has so much depth. Sundays are for thalis with gavraan rassa, Chapattis, salad, vadis and plain rice. Of course, this is called muttonacha, meaning mutton, which 1s what my mother would use, so although I\u2019ve opted for lamb, feel free to use mutton, if you wish.",

        "First make the spice powder by placing all the spice powder ingredients, except the white poppy seeds, in a frying pan (skillet) and dry-roast over a low heat for 4-5 minutes. Stir well and as the chillies begin to darken, add the poppy seeds and toast for a further 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave to cool, then grind to a fine powder in a spice grinder.",
        "Put the lamb in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle the spice powder over the top. Leave to marinate in the fridge for 2-3 hours or overnight.",
        "To make the coconut paste, toast the coconut in the same frying pan over a medium heat for 7-8 minutes, until light brown. Add the ginger and garlic and fry for 5 minutes, stirring continuously to make sure they don\u2019t burn at the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and add to a blender with enough of the water to blend to a thick paste. Set aside.",
        "When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onions and fry for 8-10 minutes until they begin to change colour. Add the marinated lamb pieces and the turmeric. Fry the lamb for 7-10 minutes to seal the meat well, stirring to make sure you scrape up anything that has stuck to the bottom of the pan.",
        "Add the coconut paste and mix well, frying for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes. Now add the water and season to taste. Stir well, bring to the boil, cover and simmer over a low heat for 50 minutes, stirring occasionally. Continue simmering for a further 30 minutes until the lamb is tender and the gravy has thickened.",
        "Garnish with fresh coriander and serve on your thali with salad, raita and phulkas."

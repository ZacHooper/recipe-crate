Serve this pork with the lime and chilli seed slaw with curry leaf oil, or with a good-quality shop-bought slaw.",

Add the pork and sear to lightly brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove the pork and set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the onions, stirring to lightly colour, about 3 minutes, then add the blitzed spice mixture, 450ml of water and 1 teaspoon of salt. Return the pork to the pan, bring to the boil, then cover with the lid and transfer to the oven to bake for 4 hours, basting every hour or so. Remove the lid and return to the oven for 80 minutes more, basting once or twice throughout, until browned and the sauce is thick and rich.",
        "Use two forks to shred the pork directly in the pan with all its juices. You can choose to shred the skin as well, or discard it. Stir in the coriander and lime juice.",
        "Place the yoghurt in a small bowl and swirl through the chutney. Serve this and the bread rolls alongside the pork, building your own plate or sandwich as you please."

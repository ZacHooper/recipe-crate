        "Heat the oven to 200\u00b0C/180\u00b0C fan/gas 6. If your squash is a butternut or thin-skinned variety, there is no need to peel it. Halve it, scoop out the seeds and cut into thick slices or boats. Lay them on a roasting tray and drizzle with the oil.",
        "Bash the coriander and cardamom seeds in a pestle and mortar. Add the chopped lemongrass and bash again to break it down a little. Scatter half this mixture over the squash with a good pinch of salt, and the chopped chillies, keeping the other half of the lemongrass mixture for later.",
        "Use a fine grater to zest 2 of the limes over the top of the squash, then cut the 2 limes in half and squeeze the juice over as well. Toss everything together and put the lot into the hot oven for 45 minutes, or until the squash is golden.",
        "Meanwhile, make the sauce. Put the reserved lemongrass mixture into a bowl with the zest and juice of the remaining limes, finely grate in the ginger, add the yoghurt and mix well.",
        "Once the squash is roasted perfectly, lay it ona serving platter, sprinkle over the peanuts and coriander leaves and serve the yoghurt on the side for spooning over."

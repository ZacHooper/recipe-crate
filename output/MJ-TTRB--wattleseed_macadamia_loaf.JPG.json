        "Combine the starter, flour and water for the starter build and mix well. Use 100 g of this for the dough and retain the rest for maintaining your starter.",
        "Combine the flours and water in a large mixing bowl and mix with your hands. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for the autolyse.",
        "When the starter is ripe and bubbly, mix it with the flour and water mixture. Add the honey and massage the mixture. Sprinkle over the salt and finish mixing the dough. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside in a warm place for at least 30 minutes before your first set of folds.",
        "Add the ground wattleseed and roughly chopped macadamias to the dough as you do the first turn and fold. Complete four sets of folds, resting the dough in between each one for 30-45 minutes.",
        "After your last set of folds, cover your dough with a damp cloth and leave to prove at room temperature for 2-3 hours.",
        "Pre-shape the dough and let it rest on the bench for 15-20 minutes. Shape the dough as desired and place it seam side up in a lightly floured proving basket. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for a few hours, or in the fridge overnight, until ready to bake.",
        "Preheat the oven to the maximum temperature and bake according to your preferred method. If using the Dutch oven, bake for 20 minutes with the lid on, then reduce the temperature to 200\u00b0C and bake for another 4-5 minutes without the lid. Keep an eye on the loaf in the final third of the bake."

    "other": [
        "Makes one loaf",
        "Use a pestle and mortar to grind the wattleseed before using. This will keep the baked loaf from having a gritty texture, and will give a more pronounced wattleseed flavour to complement the macadamias and honey.",
        "Most native and rare spices and seeds can be obtained online. If you don't have wattleseed, you could use a combination of mixed spice and cocoa powder."

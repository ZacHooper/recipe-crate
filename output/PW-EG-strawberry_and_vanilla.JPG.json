    "blurb": "This is kind of like a cheat's ice cream that you don\u2019t have to churn. It\u2019s rich and creamy, and the strawberries impart an amazing perfume as well as a little tartness to offset the sweetness. The only catch is that you have to make it the night before you want to eat it so it has time to set.",

        "Double-line a medium loaf tin with plastic wrap, making sure there is plenty of overhang.",

        "Place the egg whites in the scrupulously clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat until they start to form very stiff peaks. Stop the mixer and place the bowl to one side.",
        "In another bowl, whisk the cream until soft peaks form, then gently fold into the egg yolk mixture, along with the egg whites.",
        "Spoon one-quarter of the cream mixture into the prepared tin and give the tin a gentle tap on the bench to level the mixture out, then spoon over one-quarter of the pureed strawberries.",
        "Repeat this layering with the remaining cream and strawberries, then fold over the overhanging plastic wrap to cover. Put the tin in the freezer overnight to set.",
        "For the garnish, toss together the strawberries and icing sugar. Pop them in a covered container in the fridge to macerate overnight.",
        "To serve, remove the tin from the freezer and peel back the plastic wrap. Gently turn out the semifreddo onto a bench and remove the plastic wrap altogether. Cut into 3 cm thick slices and place on cold plates. For the garnish, spoon over the macerated strawberries and finish with a sprinkling of pistachios."

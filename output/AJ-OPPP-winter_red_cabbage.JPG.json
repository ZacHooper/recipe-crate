    "title": "Winter red cabbage & apple soup",
    "blurb": "This is a cheerful, vibrant soup which ticks all the flavour boxes. It's a soup | make all year, as it\u2019s both comforting in winter and vibrant enough to eat on a colder spring or summer day too (think borscht). Sweet red cabbage comes with a pickled edge, earthy caraway and freshness from a couple of apples. The crunch from buttery toasted walnuts, brightness from dill and some levelling creaminess from cr\u00e9me fraiche finish it off. | use an oat cr\u00e9me fraiche here but a dairy version or some thick Greek yoghurt would work too for non-vegans.",

    "title": "Pistachio and ricotta dumplings with peas and herbs",
    "blurb": "These are light, bright dumplings that are quick and easy to put together. It is a plate which is all about late spring: white, green and fresh. I use freshly podded peas here and I don\u2019t cook them: I love their pop and sweetness when they've not been cooked and they work against the softness of the ricotta. If podding peas sounds a bit much or fresh peas are hard to.get hold of for you, some briefly boiled frozen ones will work well too.",

    "blurb": "The quickest of soups that uses three of my favourite flavour boosters:\ncoconut milk, miso and tamarind. The coconut cream brings a richness\nwhich adds a depth of flavour. The miso brings umami which creates\nlayers of flavours, and the tamarind adds a sharpness which offsets\n\nthe coconut. They are ingredients | keep on hand for nights when food\nneeds to be fast. All sit happily in the cupboard or fridge for months. I've\npurposely left the choice of green veg down to you so you can use what\nyou have and what's in season. Just be sure to cut things which take a\n\nlittle longer to cook into smaller pieces, so everything cooks evenly.",

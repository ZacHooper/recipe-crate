        "2. Put the cauliflower on a large,\nparchment-lined baking tray and\ntoss with the curry powder, half\nthe oil, % teaspoon of salt and a\ngood grind of pepper. Roast for\nabout 20 minutes, until cooked\nthrough and lightly coloured.\nSet aside, and turn the oven\ntemperature down to 170\u00b0C fan.",
        "3. Meanwhile, make the\nb\u00e9chamel. Put the cubed butter\ninto a medium saucepan ona\nmedium-high heat and, once\nmelted, whisk in the flour and\ncook for 1-2 minutes \u2014 it should\nstart to smell nutty (like popcorn).\nTurn the heat down to medium\nand slowly add the milk a little\n\nat a time, whisking continuously\nto prevent any lumps, until\nincorporated and the sauce is\nsmooth. Cook, whisking often,\nfor about 7 minutes, until\nthickened slightly. Off the heat,\nstir in the garlic, mustard, cheese\nand %4 teaspoon of salt until the\ncheese has melted.",
        "4. Keep your filo sheets under\n\na damp tea towel to prevent\nthem from drying out. In a bowl,\ncombine the melted butter and\nthe remaining 1% tablespoons\nof oil and keep to one side.",
        "5. Working one sheet at a time,\nbrush the exposed side of the filo\nwith the butter mixture and drape\nit into your prepared tin (buttered\nside up), pushing it down gently\n\nto fit. Continue in this way with\n\nthe next filo sheet, brushing it\nwith butter and then laying it\nover the bottom sheet, rotating\nit slightly so the overhang drapes\n\nover the sides at a different angle.\n\nDo this with all six sheets.",
        "6. Spoon half the b\u00e9chamel into\nthe base and top with the roasted\ncauliflower florets. Spoon over\nthe remaining b\u00e9chamel, then\ncrimp up the overhang so that it\ncreates a messy \u2018scrunched-up\u2019 .\nborder around the edges, leaving\nthe centre of the pie exposed.",
        "7. Brush the top of the filo\nborder with the remaining butter\nmixture, then transfer the tin\n\nto a baking tray and bake for\n\n30 minutes.",
        "8. Using a tea towel to help\nyou, carefully release the outer\ncircle of the springform tin and\nreturn the pie to the oven for\nanother 20-25 minutes, or until\nthe sides are nicely coloured\nand everything is golden and\nbubbling. Leave to settle for\n\n15 minutes.",

    "title": "PAPPARDELLE WITH MUSHROOM & SEAWEED",
    "blurb": "Seaweed gives the sauce texture and the shiitake mushrooms have a meaty, umami flavour, but you can use any mushroom you like. Seaweed can be overpowering, so I only use a little, adding mascarpone to soften it slightly. If you do add egg yolks at the end it will give a real wow factor to the dish, but it will still taste special without.",

        "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the garlic and fry for 1 minute on a medium heat until just golden. Add the mushrooms and continue cooking for 5 minutes, stirring from time to time. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.",
        "If you are going to finish the dish with egg yolks, now is the time to crack and separate the eggs; use the whites in other dishes.",
        "Next, cook the pappardelle in a large pan of boiling salted water \u2014 this should take about 11-2 minutes. Drain, but keep a jugful of the cooking water.",
        "Put the mushroom pan back on the heat, add the mascarpone and a ladleful of pasta cooking water, then add the drained pasta and lemon juice. Cook on a medium heat until the sauce is creamy, then scatter the seaweed on top and toss everything together, or use tongs to combine it all. If the sauce looks dry, add some more cooking water and check the seasoning.",
        "Divide the pasta between four plates, then if you're finishing with a raw egg yolk, place one on top of each plate before serving, when everything is still hot. It\u2019s fun to split the egg yolk with your fork and mix it into the sauce. Put a chunk of Parmesan and the grater in the middle of the table so people can help themselves."

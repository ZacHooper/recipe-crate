    "title": "FANSACHI BHAAJI Konkani Coconut & Jackfruit Stir-Fry",
    "blurb": "This stir-fry is traditionally cooked with tender jackfruit, although I am using the tinned variety here. It gives a wonderful flavour mixed with curry leaves, coconut and jaggery. If your tinned jackfruit is soaked in salty brine, make sure you drain it, and season the final dish sparingly.",

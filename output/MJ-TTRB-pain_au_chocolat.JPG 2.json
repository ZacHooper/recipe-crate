        "Roll your rested pastry out into a rectangle roughly 50 x 40 cm (12 \u00ab 16 in) and about 8 mm (%in) thick, with the long edge towards you. Trim all the edges to create a neat rectangle and then, starting from the left-hand side, mark notches 8 cm (3%in) apart along the top and bottom edge.",
        "Use a ruler to align the first top and bottom notch and cut a straight vertical line using a sharp knife. Continue working your way along the notches until you have 5 long rectangles. Cut each rectangle in half so you have 10 pieces of pastry roughly 8 x 15 cm (3% x 6 in). Lay the rectangles flatina container or on a tray, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, to rest.",
        "Line two trays with baking paper. Take the rectangles from the fridge and lay them out ona lightly floured surface with the short edges towards you.",
        "For each piece of pastry, place a horizontal line of chocolate about a quarter of the way down from the top edge, then gently fold the top of the pastry down to cover the chocolate.",
        "Place a second line of chocolate below the edge that you've just folded, and roll the pastry from the top so the chocolate is encased and the seam is on the bottom. Don't pull it too tight - you don\u2019t want a cylinder, you want an oval-shaped pastry with a flat bottom. Transfer the pastries to a tray lined with baking paper, leaving space between each one (you will get 4-5 pastries on astandard baking tray).",
        "Lightly cover the trays with plastic wrap and leave them in a warm place (ideally 22-26\u00b0C/72: 79\u00b0F) to rise.",
        "Leave the pain au chocolat until they have risen by half ~ the time will vary depending on the temperature and humidity of the day, but this should take around! 2hours. Ona cool day, you can use your Oven as a proving box by placing a roasting pan filled with boiling water at the bottom of the oven and leaving it for about 5 minutes, to create steam. Once the ovenis slightly warm, place the trays of pastrics (still lightly covered in plastic wrap) in to prove. You should be able to see the layers in the pastry, and you can test to see if it's ready by lightly pressing into the dough. If your finger leaves a dentin the pastry, it\u2019s ready; if the dough springs back quickly it needs some more time proving, Check it againin 10. 15 minutes.",
        "Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0C (370\u00b0F). Make an egg wash by lightly beating together the egg, milk and salt. Take your first tray of pastries and lightly brush the surface of each with egg wash. Ref, rigerate the other tray until ready to bake. Place the tray on the middle shelf of the heated oven, and reduce the temperature to 170\u00b0C (340\u00b0F). Bake for 10 minutes, then check your pain au chocolat and turn the tray, if nceded, and bake fora further 4 -5 minutes, until they are golden and flaky.",
        "Remove the first tray from the oven, return the temperature to 190\u00b0C (370\u00b0) and repeat with the second tray. (You may find you can bake two trays at once if you have a ge sod fan-lorced oven.)",
        "Cool slightly on the trays belore serving."

    "blurb": "Variations of warm beans served with tahini are popular throughout the Arab world, with dishes such as chickpea fatteh and ful mudammas with tahini at the forefront. Such dishes are typically eaten warm for breakfast, and are a sure way to keep you full until dinner. They're the inspiration for these herby cannellini beans, which can easily be served at any mealtime.",

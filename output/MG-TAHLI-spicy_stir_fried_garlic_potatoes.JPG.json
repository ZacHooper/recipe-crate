Waiting in the queue on the bustling Mumbai streets with my mum for the street hawker to serve us a simple thali with this bhaaji, crispy fried puris, shrikhand and pickle on the side was always the highlight of the day. This batata mix is (dare I say!) the soul of Mumbai city \u2014 stir-fried potatoes with garlic, green chilli and turmeric.",

        "Put the sliced garlic and 3 tablespoons of oil into a small frying pan and place it on a medium heat. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until the garlic turns lightly golden. Strain the oil through a small sieve set over a bowl, and set both the garlic and oil aside separately.",
        "Use a box grater to roughly grate the plum tomatoes (p. 88), discarding the skins. Drain the grated tomato in a sieve set over a bowl and leave for about 5 minutes - you want about 400g of grated tomato pulp. Discard (or drink) the drained tomato liquid, then put the grated tomato into the bowl and stir in the crushed garlic, chilli flakes, vinegar, the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, %4 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper.",
        "Place a well-greased griddle pan on a high heat. Brush both sides of the ciabatta slices with a little olive oil to coat and, once the pan is hot, grill for about 90 seconds per side, or until nicely grilled and toasty. Do this in about two batches. Next, grill the cherry tomatoes until nicely charred and only just starting to burst a little, about 5 minutes.",
        "Place the bread slices so that they\u2019re nestled together on a plate and spoon over the grated tomato mixture. Top with the grilled cherry tomatoes and the fried garlic and its oil, then sprinkle with the oregano. Serve right away."

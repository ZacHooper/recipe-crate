If using the Dutch oven, bake for 20 minutes at maximum temperature with the lid on, then take the lid off, reduce the temperature to 200\u00b0C (390\u00b0F) and bake for another 5 minutes, or until the crust is a lovely den brown. If using a hearthstone, reduce the oven to 200\u00b0C (390\u00b0F) after you put the bread in, and check the loaf after 20 minutes. You want a deep golden brown crust, without burning.",

You will use 50 g (154 02) of this for the dough; retain the rest for maintaining your starter.",
        "If you have multiplied the recipe, divide the dough into individual loaves before you pre-shape.",
        "This bread is very good eaten about 20 minutes after baking, so it's still warm inside."
